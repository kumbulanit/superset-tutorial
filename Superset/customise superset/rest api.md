### Using REST API in Apache Superset

#### **What is a REST API?**

**REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a standard architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are widely used to interact with web services and databases due to their simplicity and scalability.

#### **Key Concepts of REST API:**

- **Resource:** An object or representation of data, such as a user or a dataset.
- **Endpoint:** The URL where the API can be accessed, typically consisting of a base URL and a resource path.
- **HTTP Methods:** Common methods include:
  - **GET:** Retrieve data.
  - **POST:** Create new data.
  - **PUT:** Update existing data.
  - **DELETE:** Remove data.
- **Request:** The call made to the API, which includes the method, URL, headers, and possibly a body.
- **Response:** The data returned by the API, usually in JSON format, including a status code indicating success or failure.

#### **Steps to Use REST API in Apache Superset**

**1. Understand the API Endpoints:**

Superset provides a REST API to interact with various resources, including dashboards, charts, and datasets. Refer to the [Superset API documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/rest-api) for available endpoints.

**2. Set Up Authentication:**

Superset uses token-based authentication. You need to obtain an authentication token to access the API.

**3. Make API Requests:**

You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or any programming language with HTTP capabilities (e.g., Python's `requests` library) to interact with the API.

**4. Handle API Responses:**

Process the JSON responses from the API to obtain the data you need.

### **Example: Using Superset's REST API**

**1. Obtain an Authentication Token**

To interact with the Superset API, first authenticate to get a token:

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/security/login' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "admin", "provider": "db", "refresh": true}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

**2. List Datasets**

Use the token to list datasets available in Superset.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/dataset/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "result": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "table_name": "sales_data",
      "database": {
        "id": 1,
        "database_name": "my_database"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**3. Create a New Dashboard**

To create a new dashboard, send a POST request with the dashboard details.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/dashboard/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"dashboard_title": "New Dashboard", "slug": "new_dashboard", "position_json": "{}"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "dashboard_title": "New Dashboard",
  "slug": "new_dashboard",
  "position_json": "{}"
}
```

**4. Update a Chart**

Update chart properties using a PUT request.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X PUT \
  'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/chart/1' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slice_name": "Updated Chart", "viz_type": "line"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "slice_name": "Updated Chart",
  "viz_type": "line"
}
```

**5. Delete a Dashboard**

To delete a dashboard, send a DELETE request.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE \
  'http://localhost:8088/api/v1/dashboard/1' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "deleted"
}
```

### **Conclusion**

Using Supersetâ€™s REST API allows you to automate interactions with your data visualizations, manage dashboards and charts programmatically, and integrate Superset with other systems. By understanding the API endpoints, setting up authentication, making requests, and handling responses, you can effectively use the API to enhance your data operations.
